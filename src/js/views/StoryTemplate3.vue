          <p>When news first broke in 2014 about the Flint, Michigan water crisis, Assistant Professor of Sociology Katrinell Davis, Ph.D., was as surprised as the rest of America, but for a different reason: that it took so long for a public health disaster
            to happen in her hometown. Davis experienced inadequate public services first-hand while growing up in Flint, motivating her to become an expert on how public policy disproportionately affects lower-income communities. Her research examines
            the intersection of race, gender, and work trends within the American labor market and how it negatively affects working people. Ô‰ was looking at this in 2012, well before anyone was concerned about environmental injustice in Flint," says
            Davis, who is working on a highly anticipated book on the topic. </p>
